    "# Approach:\n",
    "To find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing in an integer array `nums`, we can utilize a set to keep track of the unique elements encountered. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty set, `seen`, to keep track of unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize variables `duplicate` and `total` to store the number that occurs twice and the sum of numbers from 1 to n, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Iterate through each element, `num`, in the `nums` array:\n",
    "   - If `num` is already in the `seen` set, assign `num` to `duplicate`.\n",
    "   - Add `num` to the `seen` set.\n",
    "   - Increment `total` by `num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula `expected_sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the missing number by subtracting `total - duplicate` from the `expected_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Return the array `[duplicate, missing]`, where `duplicate` is the number that occurs twice and `missing` is the number that is missing.\n"
